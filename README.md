[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-Click%20Here-blue)](https://github.com/Amulya-Yadav/U-Net-PyTorch/releases)

## üìñ Overview

U-Net-PyTorch provides a full implementation of the U-Net model from scratch in PyTorch. This software helps users perform image segmentation, particularly for tasks like brain tumor identification. With a simple interface, this tool enables even those without programming knowledge to use it effectively.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with U-Net-PyTorch, you just need to follow these steps:

### 1. System Requirements

Make sure your computer meets these basic requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **RAM:** At least 8 GB recommended
- **Storage:** At least 2 GB of free space
- **Python Version:** 3.6 or higher
- **PyTorch:** Compatible version for your system; visit the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for guidance.

### 2. Download & Install

Follow these steps to download and run U-Net-PyTorch:

1. **Visit the Releases Page:** Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Amulya-Yadav/U-Net-PyTorch/releases) to find the latest version of U-Net-PyTorch.
  
2. **Download the Release:** Click on the version you want to download. Look for the executable file or compressed folder that suits your operating system. 

3. **Extract the Files:** If you downloaded a compressed file, right-click on it and choose "Extract All," then select a place on your computer to store the files.

4. **Run the Application:** Locate the extracted folder and double-click the application file (e.g., `U-Net-PyTorch.exe` or equivalent). This launches the user interface where you can start your image segmentation task.

## üîß How to Use

U-Net-PyTorch lets you perform segmentation with just a few clicks.

### 1. Input Your Image

- Click on the upload button to select an image from your computer.
- Ensure your image is in a supported format (PNG, JPG).

### 2. Set Parameters

You will see options to set various parameters for the segmentation:

- **Model Type:** Choose the U-Net model.
- **Segmentation Mode:** Select the type of segmentation you need (e.g., binary segmentation for tumor detection).

### 3. Start Segmentation

Once you‚Äôve set everything, click on the "Segment" button. The application will process your image and display the results.

## üåü Features

- **Intuitive Interface:** Designed for ease of use; no coding necessary.
- **High Performance:** Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for accurate results.
- **Customization:** Adjust various settings to refine the segmentation output.
- **Save Results:** Easily save the segmented images back to your computer.
